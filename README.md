# FigureGround
Figure-ground segmentation and analysis of natural scenes

Requirements: Medical Imaging Toolbox in Matlab, Figure/ground dataset from Zenodo, UT Austin dataset

Note: If you want to recompute optic flow from scratch, do not try to load in RAW files, but instead you'll need to load in the PNG files from Zenodo.
